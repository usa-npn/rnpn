# rnpn (development version)

* `nnpn` no longer depends on the `sp` or `raster` packages
* `terra` is now a suggested dependency and users will be prompted to install it only when it is needed
* `npn_get_point_data()` now uses https instead of http
* `npn_get_layer_details()` now returns a tibble instead of a data frame
* `rnpn` now requires the `xml2` package instead of `XML`
* `npn_phenophase_details()` now takes a vector of phenophase IDs rather than a list
* Functions that previously returned `data.frame` objects now return tibbles. Where they previously returned `NULL` on errors, they now return empty 0x0 tibbles.
* `npn_get_phenophases_for_taxon()` now returns a tibble rather than a list.
* Documented a behavior of `npn_species_type()` where setting `kingdom` to `NULL` returns results for *both* `Plantae` and `Animalia`. 
* Missing values returned by `npn_stations_by_state()` previously returned as the string `"emptyvalue"` are now returned as `NA`s.
* `rnpn` now has `dplyr` as a dependency instead of `plyr`
* `rnpn` now uses `httr2` instead of `httr`
* `...` is no longer used for functions that get observational data
* Fixed a bug (#42) where returned value of `npn_get_agdd_point_data()` was inconsistent depending on whether it was cached or not.
