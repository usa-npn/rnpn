#' Download Status and Intensity Records
#'
#' This function allows for a parameterized search of all status records in the
#' USA-NPN database, returning all records as per the search parameters in a
#' data table. Data fetched from NPN services is returned as raw JSON before
#' being channeled into a data table. Optionally results can be directed to an
#' output file in which case the raw JSON is converted to CSV and saved to file;
#' in that case, data is also streamed to file which allows for more easily
#' handling of the data if the search otherwise returns more data than can be
#' handled at once in memory.
#'
#' Most search parameters are optional. However, users are encouraged to supply
#' additional search parameters to get results that are easier to work with.
#' `request_source` must be provided. This is a self-identifying string, telling
#' the service who is asking for the data or from where the request is being
#' made. It is recommended you provide your name or organization name. If the
#' call to this function is acting as an intermediary for a client, then you may
#' also optionally provide a user email and/or IP address for usage data
#' reporting later.
#'
#' Additional fields provides the ability to specify more, non-critical fields
#' to include in the search results. A complete list of additional fields can be
#' found in the NPN service's [companion
#' documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yNjupricKOAXn6tY1sI7-EwkcfwdGUZ7lxYv7fcPjO8/edit#heading=h.w0nctgedhaop).

#'   provided in the same request, `phenophase_id` will be ignored.
#' @param wkt WKT geometry by which filter data. Specifying a valid WKT within
#'   the contiguous US will filter data based on the locations which fall within
#'   that WKT.
#' @returns Data table of all status records returned as per the search
#'   parameters. `NULL` if output directed to file.

#'
#' This data type includes estimates of the dates of phenophase onsets and ends

#' Download Site Phenometrics
#'
#' This function allows for a parameterized search of all site phenometrics

#' than can be handled at once in memory.
#'
#' This data type includes estimates of the overall onset and end of phenophase
#' activity for plant and animal species at a site over a user-defined time
#' period. Each row provides the first and last occurrences of a given
#' phenophase on a given species, beginning with the date of the first observed
#' "yes" phenophase status record and ending with the date of the last observed
#' "yes" record of the user-defined time period. For plant species where
#' multiple individuals are monitored at the site, the date provided for "first
#' yes" is the mean of the first "yes" records for each individual plant at the
#' site, and the date for "last yes" is the mean of the last "yes" records. Note
#' that a phenophase may have ended and restarted during the overall period of
#' its activity at the site. These more fine-scale patterns can be explored in

#' Download Magnitude Phenometrics
#'
#' This function allows for a parameterized search of all magnitude phenometrics
#' in the USA-NPN database, returning all records as per the search results in a
#' data table. Data fetched from NPN services is returned as raw JSON before
#' being channeled into a data table. Optionally results can be directed to an
#' output file in which case raw JSON is saved to file; in that case, data is
#' also streamed to file which allows for more easily handling of the data if
#' the search otherwise returns more data than can be handled at once in memory.
#'
#' This data type includes various measures of the extent to which a phenophase
#' for a plant or animal species is expressed across multiple individuals and
#' sites over a user-selected set of time intervals. Each row provides up to
#' eight calculated measures summarized weekly, bi-weekly, monthly or over a
#' custom time interval. These measures include approaches to evaluate the shape
#' of an annual activity curve, including the total number of "yes" records and
#' the proportion of "yes" records relative to the total number of status
#' records over the course of a calendar year for a region of interest. They
#' also include several approaches for standardizing animal abundances by
#' observer effort over time and space (e.g. mean active bird individuals per
#' hour). See the Metadata window for more information.
#'
#' Most search parameters are optional, however, failing to provide even a
#' single search parameter will return all results in the database.
#' Request_Source must be provided. This is a self-identifying string, telling
#' the service who is asking for the data or from where the request is being
#' made. It is recommended you provide your name or organization name. If the
#' call to this function is acting as an intermediary for a client, then you may
#' also optionally provide a user email and/or IP address for usage data
#' reporting later.
#'
#' Additional fields provides the ability to specify more, non-critical fields
#' to include in the search results. A complete list of additional fields can be
#' found in the NPN service's [companion documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yNjupricKOAXn6tY1sI7-EwkcfwdGUZ7lxYv7fcPjO8/edit#heading=h.df3zspopwq98).
#' Metadata on all fields can be found in the following Excel sheet:
#' <http://www.usanpn.org/files/metadata/magnitude_phenometrics_datafield_descriptions.xlsx>
#'
#' @inheritParams npn_download_status_data
#' @param period_frequency Required field, integer. The integer value specifies
#'   the number of days by which to delineate the period of time specified by
#'   the start_date and end_date, i.e. a value of 7 will delineate the period of
#'   time weekly. Any remainder days are grouped into the final delineation.
#'   This parameter, while typically an int, also allows for a "special" string
#'   value, "months" to be passed in. Specifying this parameter as "months" will
#'   delineate the period of time by the calendar months regardless of how many
#'   days are in each month. Defaults to `30` if omitted.
#' @inheritParams npn_download_site_phenometrics
#' @returns Data table of all status records returned as per the search
#'   parameters. `NULL` if output directed to file.

#' Get Data By Year
#'
#' Utility function to chain multiple requests to [npn_get_data] for requests
#' where data should only be retrieved on an annual basis, or otherwise
#' automatically be delineated in some way. Results in a data table that's a
#' combined set of the results from each request to the data service.
#'
#' @param endpoint String, the endpoint to query.
#' @param query Base query string to use. This includes all the user selected
#'   parameters but doesn't include start/end date which will be automatically
#'   generated and added.
#' @param years Character vector; the years for which to retrieve data. There
#'   will be one request to the service for each year
#' @param download_path Character, optional file path to the file for which to
#'   output the results.
#' @param six_leaf_layer Boolean value when set to `TRUE` will attempt to
#'   resolve the date of the observation to a spring index, leafing value for
#'   the location at which the observations was taken.
#' @param six_bloom_layer Boolean value when set to `TRUE` will attempt to
#'   resolve the date of the observation to a spring index, bloom value for the
#'   location at which the observations was taken.
#' @param agdd_layer Numeric value, accepts `32` or `50`. When set, the results
#'   will attempt to resolve the date of the observation to an AGDD value for
#'   the location; the `32` or `50` represents the base value of the AGDD value
#'   returned. All AGDD values are based on a January 1st start date of the year
#'   in which the observation was taken.
#' @param six_sub_model Affects the results of the six layers returned. Can be
#'   used to specify one of three submodels used to calculate the spring index
#'   values. Thus setting this field will change the results of `six_leaf_layer`
#'   and `six_bloom_layer`. Valid values include: `'lilac'`, `'zabelli'` and
#'   `'arnoldred'`. For more information see the NPN's Spring Index Maps
#'   documentation: <https://www.usanpn.org/data/spring_indices>.
#' @param additional_layers Data frame with first column named `name` and
#'   containing the names of the layer for which to retrieve data and the second
#'   column named `param` and containing string representations of the
#'   time/elevation subset parameter to use. This variable can be used to append
#'   additional geospatial layer data fields to the results, such that the date
#'   of observation in each row will resolve to a value from the specified
#'   layers, given the location of the observation.
#' @returns Data table—a data table combining each requests results from the
#'   service.
