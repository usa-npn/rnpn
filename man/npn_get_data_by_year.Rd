\usage{
npn_get_data_by_year(
  endpoint,
  query,
  years,
  download_path = NULL,
  six_leaf_layer = FALSE,
  six_bloom_layer = FALSE,
  agdd_layer = NULL,
  six_sub_model = NULL,
  additional_layers = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{endpoint}{String, the endpoint to query.}

\item{query}{Base query string to use. This includes all the user selected
parameters but doesn't include start/end date which will be automatically
generated and added.}

\item{years}{Character vector; the years for which to retrieve data. There
will be one request to the service for each year}

\item{download_path}{Character, optional file path to the file for which to
output the results.}

\item{six_leaf_layer}{Boolean value when set to \code{TRUE} will attempt to
resolve the date of the observation to a spring index, leafing value for
the location at which the observations was taken.}

\item{six_bloom_layer}{Boolean value when set to \code{TRUE} will attempt to
resolve the date of the observation to a spring index, bloom value for the
location at which the observations was taken.}

\item{agdd_layer}{Numeric value, accepts \code{32} or \code{50}. When set, the results
will attempt to resolve the date of the observation to an AGDD value for
the location; the \code{32} or \code{50} represents the base value of the AGDD value
returned. All AGDD values are based on a January 1st start date of the year
in which the observation was taken.}

\item{six_sub_model}{Affects the results of the six layers returned. Can be
used to specify one of three submodels used to calculate the spring index
values. Thus setting this field will change the results of \code{six_leaf_layer}
and \code{six_bloom_layer}. Valid values include: \code{'lilac'}, \code{'zabelli'} and
\code{'arnoldred'}. For more information see the NPN's Spring Index Maps
documentation: \url{https://www.usanpn.org/data/spring_indices}.}

\item{additional_layers}{Data frame with first column named \code{name} and
containing the names of the layer for which to retrieve data and the second
column named \code{param} and containing string representations of the
time/elevation subset parameter to use. This variable can be used to append
additional geospatial layer data fields to the results, such that the date
of observation in each row will resolve to a value from the specified
layers, given the location of the observation.}
}
\value{
A tibble combining each requests results from the service. If
\code{download_path} is specified, the file path is returned instead.
}
\description{
Utility function to chain multiple requests to \link{npn_get_data} for requests
where data should only be retrieved on an annual basis, or otherwise
automatically be delineated in some way. Results in a data table that's a
combined set of the results from each request to the data service.
