I have read and agree to the the CRAN policies at
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

## Resubmission

This is a resubmission to clean up files, remove rgdal dependencies and change maintainer.

## Test environments

devtools::check and devtools::check_win_release passed.

## R CMD check results

There were no NOTEs or WARNINGs.

There is an ERORR pertaining to a test, however the test is skipped on CRAN and should not present an issue. As this package is an API wrapper, many tests do not pass.

## Downstream dependencies

There were no downstream dependencies.

## Other Notes

NA
